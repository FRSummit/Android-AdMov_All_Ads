Now that Coronavirus is sweeping the globe as a pandemic, we’re all afraid for the health of ourselves and our loved ones. People all across the world are pinching pennies to make rent and support their families. Parents are forced to put their work (and potentially income) on hold to homeschool their kids… that is if their kid is even old enough for school. If not, then they suddenly need to provide 24/7 childcare while keeping up a job. And, everyone everywhere must stay away from social situations. It’s scary. And isolating. And lonely. Yet, we have the tools at our fingertips to help each other. Even in isolation, we’re still connected.");

In an effort to slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19), schools have closed for the year and businesses have shuttered indefinitely. Health officials are imploring the public to stay home and cancel any in-person social interactions.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "These mandatory closures in the interest of public health are causing massive disruptions in everyday life. And, while the first few days of isolation may feel like a welcome chance to lay low for a bit, here’s the reality: the news is scary, we’re in this for the long haul, and lack of human interaction can feel really freakin’ lonely.\n" +

Our model has always leveraged kind, empathetic people with a wifi connection from the comfort of their own home. We’re here. We’re ready. We were made for this. And, most importantly, your feelings are valid. You deserve kindness. We’re here to help. Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a Crisis Counselor.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. Get some fresh air. Social distancing doesn’t mean you can’t go outside as long as you keep a distance from anyone who isn’t part of your family. Go for a walk! Take a hike! Do some outdoor yoga! The natural world is your oyster. Dive in.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. Prioritize mental check-ins. Now is the time to pick up meditation, start journaling, or tap into some mindfulness techniques. We love this grounding technique. Or, you can tune into Lizzo’s meditation Instagram Live. That works, too.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "4. Connect. Skip the scrolling and make your time online intentional. If you’re used to working in an office and are suddenly working from home full-time, chances are you’re missing one of the best parts of work—friends. Instead of diving right into virtual meetings, spend some time catching up and checking in on each other. Schedule virtual hangouts with your pals. Take your usual lunchtime and get on a group FaceTime. Or, if you’re still in school and studying from home, set up a virtual study session to cheer each other on as you go.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "5. Turn off those notifications. When you’re stuck at home all day in times like these, it can be easy to get sucked into an endless hole of news updates. Schedule a few dedicated times throughout the day to check in with the news and get the most important updates. No need for the minute-by-minute play-by-play of COVID-19 happenings to make you spiral.");
